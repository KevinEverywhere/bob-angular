				<h2>How many Dimensions do you Need?</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to the bob-angular seed site. This seed was created for developers to be able to 
					quickly build angular applications using a 3D metaphor and current JavaScript frameworks.
					The content selection is intended to demonstrate how a variety of distinct interactive
					elements function within a 3D metaphor. All of the controls you are familiar with work
					in the 3D animations.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is one You Tube example, one Leaflet map example, and one SVG example. Bootstrap, 
					Less, and JQuery are used generously. The principal intention of the seed is to free
					us from the confines of the 2D Web. These examples show how straightforward it is to map
					HTML content to 3D space. All modern browsers and devices support the content on this site.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>This site is in constant development.</em> </p>
				<p>
					Content will be added regularly as it is stable.
					Please visit the github page for more information.
