				<h2>How many Dimensions do you Need?</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to the bob-angular seed site. This seed was created for developers to be able to quickly build angular applications using a 3D metaphor with <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> and current JavaScript frameworks. The content selection is intended to demonstrate how a variety of distinct interactive elements function within a 3D metaphor. All of the controls you are familiar with work in the 3D animations.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is one You Tube example, one Leaflet map example, and one SVG example. Bootstrap, 
					Less, and JQuery are used throughout. The principal intention of the seed is to sow the
					mind to think of how to leave the confines of the 2D Web. All modern browsers and devices 
					support the content on this site.
				</p>
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>
					Why is it different, and why should you care? There have been a number of attempts to bring 3D / CSS3 interactive functionality to the Web. They each have their strengths, and their use may make more sense for achieving a specific objective. Often, they are done in a proprietary fashion, or with a subset of functionality available to typical Web content. This seed is intended to be vendor and technology agnostic and is not endorsed by nor see as an endorsement for any of the technologies used.  
				</p>
				<p>
					My role in all this is, while not altogether non-trivial, is that of a dot connector. All of the abilities for the distinct pieces to function come from the vendors, such as Google, Leaflet, three.js, and others. Often, approaching a project that requires distinct learning curves in so many moving pieces can be daunting. By including a number of use-cases in a single application, one can see how to overcome a number of development challenges.
				</p>
				<p>
					The animation and interactivity here ia the iceberg tip. Once you know what can be done, you can do much more with your own ideas. If you are a 3D modeler, for instance, you can developing a 3D scene in Max, export it as a collada model, then use it through three.js. If the scene includes a screen or element which can benefit from having live content within it, a 3d positioned element can be placed from angular directly into the rendered model. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For those looking how to map interactive content on 3D objects, I followed the straight 
					forward method that three.js suggest, with a little 
					alchemy inspired by <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_periodictable.html">their 
					periodic table example. Using the 
					<a href="http://threejs.org/examples/js/renderers/CSS3DRenderer.js">CSS3DRenderer</a>,
					one can insert all manner of standard Web content into the face of a 3d object. Here,
					HTML, video, map and SVG elements are actively accessible while animating in 3d space.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to three, less.js does a good deal of the presentation work: for each resize
					and each resolution, less calculates the optimal display of the content and updates the
					relevant CSS dynamically. Together with bootstrap, the combination of front end 
					methods of ensuring engaging 3D display can be managed effectively at a high level.
				</p>
