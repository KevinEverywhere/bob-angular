				<h2>How many Dimensions do you Need?</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to the bob-angular seed site. This seed was created to enable developers to quickly build angular applications using a 3D metaphor with <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> and current JavaScript frameworks. The content selection is intended to demonstrate how a variety of distinct interactive elements function within a 3D metaphor. All of the controls you are familiar with work in the 3D animations.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is one You Tube example, one Leaflet map example, and one SVG example. Bootstrap, Less, and JQuery are used throughout. This section uses the jumbotron class, for instance, and tooltips can be seen when mousing over the feed items in the footer below. The principal intention of the seed is to inspire others to leave the confines of the 2D Web. All modern browsers and devices support the content on this site.
				</p>
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>
					Why is it different, and why should you care? The secret sauce used here to bring 2D content into the 3D world is the manner that three.js appears to enable you to insert a DOM element into a WebGL canvas. Three, by default, replaces a Div element with a canvas element. In actuality, the DOM element that is injected into the canvas is mapped by CSS3 descriptors, which enables it to mimic actual WebGL rendering and animation. Each of the four elements in this application interface (the top ledge, the footer, the main content and the context panel) are individual 3D content panes, and any or all of them can be replaced by standard 2D Web content and work together harmoniously. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The animation and interactivity here are the iceberg tip. Once you know what can be done, you can do much more with your own ideas. If you are a 3D modeler, for instance, you can develop a scene in 3D Studio Max, export it as a collada file, then use it with three.js. If the scene includes a screen or element which can benefit from having live content within it, a 3d positioned element can be placed from angular directly into the rendered model. Think of a 3D walk through of a living room with a wall-mounted TV playing a current live feed, for example.
				</p>
				<p>
					For those looking how to map interactive content on 3D objects, I followed the straight 
					forward method that three.js suggest, with a little 
					alchemy inspired by <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_periodictable.html">their 
					periodic table example</a>. Using the 
					<a href="http://threejs.org/examples/js/renderers/CSS3DRenderer.js">CSS3DRenderer</a>,
					one can insert all manner of standard Web content into the face of a 3d object. Here,
					HTML, video, map and SVG elements are actively accessible while animating in 3d space.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to three, less.js does a good deal of the presentation work: for each resize
					and each resolution, less calculates the optimal display of the content and updates the
					relevant CSS dynamically. Together with bootstrap, the combination of front end 
					methods of ensuring engaging 3D display can be managed effectively at a high level.
