{"name":"bob-angular","tagline":"An evolving angular-three.js seed","body":"###version 0.0.0\r\n\r\n*This is in development and is not recommended to develop with as a base until version 0.0.1. You can still look under the hood to see how things work by following the installation process.*\r\n\r\nThe sample application that is built from this code is viewable at \r\n[bob-angular](http://bob-angular.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\nThis project is an application skeleton, influenced by and forked from [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). It uses [three.js](http://threejs.org/) to provide a means to map 2D Web content to 3D space. \r\n\r\nThe application is preconfigured to install the Angular framework, three.js, and required third-party frameworks. The seed app contains video, Leaflet map tiles, SVG and HTML content, built on top of bootstrap, JQuery, less and other familiar frameworks. It also includes unit and e2e tests.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nYou must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. All other dependencies\r\nare managed by node through package.json, and then bower through bower.json. You can \r\nget node and npm from [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/).\r\n\r\n### Clone bob-angular\r\n\r\nIn the terminal, in the directory where you want to install the app, git clone the \r\nbob-angular repository. Then, run *npm start* to install and launch the node \r\nweb server; or *npm install* and *bower install* to merely install the application\r\ndependencies. \r\n\r\n*Permission issues may occur if the directory permission and user permissions are different.*\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/KevinEverywhere/bob-angular.git\r\ncd bob-angular\r\nnpm start \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install Dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are server-side, application and testing dependencies loaded in  `npm`, \r\nthe [node package manager][npm], and in the front-end development dependencies\r\nthrough `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].\r\n\r\nThe npm install and npm start scripts will install two new directories, \r\nand then populate them with imported code:\r\n\r\n* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need\r\n* `app/libs` - contains the angular framework files\r\n\r\n*The `libs` folder is put into the app folder  through the `.bowerrc` file when \r\n'bower install' is run.\r\n\r\n### Run the Application\r\n\r\nThe application should be testable in localhost:3000 by running _npm start_. If that port is already being used, look at the console to see which port that the application found available.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe app should now be running at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> (or an alternative that was found to be available at runtime).\r\n\r\n####Troubleshooting\r\nThe most typical problems in _npm start_ involve permission issues, availability of port, and software availability. Ensure that you have the correct software installed to begin, and that the directory in which you are running npm start contains the bob-angular seed files. Consult your console, and Google, to take care of any issues unique to your system.\r\n\r\n## Directory Layout\r\n\r\n```\r\nindex.js                               --> the file containing the webserver\r\napp/                                   --> application source files\r\n  assets/                              --> media, CSS JS, JSON assets\r\n    css, js, media\r\n  components/                          --> view or feature based components\r\n    footer, main, context, navigation  --> view components\r\n    youtube, leaflet, svg              --> feature (vendor) based components\r\n  shared/                              --> feature based shared services\r\n    three_module, country_module        \r\n  libs/                                --> repository for bower-created \r\n    3l, angular, bootstrap, three.js,      source files from 'npm start' or  \r\n    jquery, less, ui-router, others        'bower install' \r\n  app.js                               --> main application module\r\n  index.html                           --> the entrace point to the app.\r\nkarma.conf.js                          --> config file for Karma unit tests \r\ntests/                                 --> supporting files for tests \r\ne2e-tests/                             --> end-to-end tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Unit Tests\r\n\r\nThe karma unit tests are set up in the components folders that they are associated with. Additional tests will be developed for services distinctly and throughout the app as opportunities are identified.\r\n\r\nSample file and location:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp/components/footer/footer.html\r\n                      footer.js\r\n                      footer_test.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the footer_test file contains the actual karma tests that are run.  To run the unit tests, enter the following into the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n### E2E Tests                      \r\n\r\nThe E2E tests require two terminal windows to be open: one with the local server, the other for protractor. This is facilitated by first starting the server by entering the following into the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\nThis window will launch an express server at localhost:3000. If this port is not available, you may need to edit exports.index.js. The console will give you a message to start the actual protractor in a new terminal window. From the same directory where you launched the server, bob-angular, enter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run protractor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results of the tests will be given in the second console window after running the script.\r\n\r\n\r\n### One Script for Unit and E2E Tests\r\n\r\nA streamlined testing mechanism is available through entering the following command at the root of the repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run fulltest\r\n```\r\nThis will run the unit tests first and then launch the server for protractor e2e testing in a second window. The e2e component requires you to open a new window while the server is running in the original window. From the same directory where you launched the server, bob-angular, enter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run protractor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe e2e testing will be expanded soon to iOS and other devices. \r\n\r\nThis software is dynamic and will be evolving. As features are added, they will be associated with test files and methods as needed.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nFor more information on bob-angular please contact kevin@planetkevin.com\r\n\r\n[angular]: http://angularjs.org/\r\n[three]: http://threejs.org/\r\n[express]: http://expressjs.com/\r\n[git]: http://git-scm.com/\r\n[bower]: http://bower.io\r\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/\r\n[node]: http://nodejs.org\r\n[less]: http://lesscss.org/\r\n[leaflet]:http://leafletjs.com/\r\n[protractor]: https://github.com/angular/protractor\r\n[jasmine]: http://jasmine.github.io\r\n[karma]: http://karma-runner.github.io\r\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
