{"name":"Bob-angular","tagline":"An evolving angular-three.js seed","body":"###version 0.0.0\r\n\r\n*This is in development and is not recommended to develop with as a base until version 0.0.1. You can still look under the hood to see how things work by following the installation process.*\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is an application skeleton, influenced by and forked from angular-seed,\r\n[https://github.com/angular/angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)\r\nIt uses three.js [http://threejs.org/] to provide a means to map 2D Web content to 3D space. \r\n\r\nThe application is preconfigured to install the Angular framework, three.js, and required third-party frameworks. The seed app contains video, Leaflet map tiles, SVG and HTML content, built on top of bootstrap, JQuery, less and other familiar frameworks. It also includes unit and e2e tests.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nYou must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. All other dependencies\r\nare managed by node through package.json, and then bower thrugh bower.json. You can \r\nget node and npm from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).\r\n\r\n### Clone bob-angular\r\n\r\nIn the terminal, in the directory where you want to install the app, git clone the \r\nbob-angular repository. Then, run *npm start* to install and launch the node \r\nweb server; or *npm install* and *bower install* to merely install the application\r\ndependencies. \r\n\r\n*Permission issues may occur if the directory permission and user permissions are different.*\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/KevinEverywhere/bob-angular.git\r\ncd bob-angular\r\nnpm start \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install Dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are server-side, application and testing dependencies loaded in  `npm`, \r\nthe [node package manager][npm], and in the front-end development dependencies\r\nthrough `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].\r\n\r\nThe npm install and npm start scripts will install two new directories, \r\nand then populate them with imported code:\r\n\r\n* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need\r\n* `app/libs` - contains the angular framework files\r\n\r\n*The `libs` folder is put into the app folder  through the `.bowerrc` file when \r\n'bower install' is run.\r\n\r\n### Run the Application\r\n\r\nThe application should be testable in localhost:3000 by running _npm start_. If that port is already being used, look at the console to see which port that the application found available.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe app should now be running at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> (or an alternative that was found to be available at runtime).\r\n\r\n####Troubleshooting\r\nThe most typical problems in _npm start_ involve permission issues, availability of port, and software availability. Ensure that you have the correct software installed to begin, and that the directory in which you are running npm start contains the bob-angular seed files. Consult your console, and Google, to take care of any issues unique to your system.\r\n\r\n## Directory Layout\r\n\r\n```\r\nindex.js                               --> the file containing the webserver\r\napp/                                   --> application source files\r\n  assets/                              --> media, CSS JS, JSON assets\r\n    css, js, media\r\n  components/                          --> view or feature based components\r\n    footer, main, context, navigation  --> view components\r\n    youtube, leaflet, svg              --> feature (vendor) based components\r\n  shared/                              --> feature based shared services\r\n    three_module, country_module        \r\n  libs/                                --> repository for bower-created \r\n    3l, angular, bootstrap, three.js,      source files from 'npm start' or  \r\n    jquery, less, ui-router, others        'bower install' \r\n  app.js                               --> main application module\r\n  index.html                           --> the entrace point to the app.\r\nkarma.conf.js                          --> config file for Karma unit tests \r\nTODO:\r\n  index-async.html                     --> index.html with asynchronous loads\r\ne2e-tests/                             --> end-to-end tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThere will be two kinds of tests in the bob-angular seed application: Unit tests and End to End tests.\r\n\r\nThis section will be expanded as the content is updated and made available for view and testing.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nFor more information on bob-angular please contact kevin@planetkevin.com\r\n\r\n[angular]: http://angularjs.org/\r\n[git]: http://git-scm.com/\r\n[bower]: http://bower.io\r\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/\r\n[node]: http://nodejs.org\r\n[less]: http://lesscss.org/\r\n[leaflet]:http://leafletjs.com/\r\n[protractor]: https://github.com/angular/protractor\r\n[jasmine]: http://jasmine.github.io\r\n[karma]: http://karma-runner.github.io\r\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/\r\n[http-server]: https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
