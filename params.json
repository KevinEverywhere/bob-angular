{"name":"bob-angular","tagline":"An evolving angular-three.js seed","body":"###version 0.0.0\r\n\r\n*bob-angular is currently in ongoing development. It will progress to version 0.0.1 when all initial functionality, unit and end to end tests are in place.*\r\n\r\nThe sample application that is built from this code is viewable at \r\n[bob-angular][bobangular]. The client-side code can be seen at the \r\n[bob-angular-app][bobangularApp] repository.\r\n\r\nThis project is influenced by and borrows from [angular-seed][angularseed]. It uses [three.js][three] to provide a means to map 2D Web content to 3D space. It also contains an [express][express] server, with [node][node]-[postgres][postgres] backend.\r\n\r\nThe application is preconfigured to install the [Angular][angular] framework, three.js, and required third-party frameworks. The seed app contains video, [Leaflet][leaflet] map tiles, SVG and HTML content, built on top of [bootstrap][bootstrap], [JQuery][jquery], [less][less] and other familiar frameworks. It also includes unit and e2e tests. The application itself is built by grunt into the dist directory. It is built during the install process and can be seen at the bob-angular-app repository.\r\n\r\n### Feedback and Blog\r\n\r\nA blog is being launched at [https://bobangular.wordpress.com/][bobangularWP]\r\nYou must have [node.js][node] and its package manager ([npm][npm]) installed. All other dependencies\r\nare managed by node through package.json, and then [bower][bower] through bower.json and [grunt][grunt]\r\nthrough Gruntfile. You can get node and npm from [nodejs][node].\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nYou must have [node.js][node] and its package manager ([npm][npm]) installed. All other dependencies\r\nare managed by node through package.json, and then [bower][bower] through bower.json and [grunt][grunt]\r\nthrough Gruntfile. You can get node and npm from [nodejs][node].\r\n\r\n### Clone bob-angular\r\n\r\nIn the terminal, in the directory where you want to install the app, git clone the \r\nbob-angular repository. Then, run *npm start* to install and launch the node \r\nweb server; or *npm install* to merely install the application dependencies without\r\nlaunching the web server. \r\n\r\n*Permission issues may occur if the directory permission and user permissions are different.*\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/KevinEverywhere/bob-angular.git\r\ncd bob-angular\r\nnpm start \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install Dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are server-side, application and testing dependencies loaded in [npm][npm], \r\nthe node package manager, and in the front-end development dependencies through \r\n[bower][bower], a client-side code package manager.\r\n\r\nThe npm install and npm start scripts will install two new directories, \r\nand then populate them with imported code:\r\n\r\n* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need\r\n* `app/libs` - contains the angular framework files\r\n\r\n*The `libs` folder is put into the app folder  through the `.bowerrc` file when \r\n'bower install' is run.\r\n\r\n### Distribute Code\r\n\r\nThe next step is handled internally: through Gruntfile, grunt selects the \r\nnecessary files from app/libs and creates a directory structure child to the \r\ndist directory. The application run from app and dist/app are the same in \r\nfunction, but dist/app files are less than a quarter the size.\r\n\r\n### Run the Application\r\n\r\nThe application should be testable in localhost:3000 by running _npm start_. \r\nIf that port is already being used, look at the console to see which port \r\nthat the application found available.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe app should now be running at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> (or an alternative that was found to be available at runtime).\r\n\r\n####Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n_The most common errors with installation require nothing more than running the start or install commands two or more times._ \r\n\r\nThe most typical problems in _npm start_ involve permission issues, availability of port, and software availability. The first thing I always try with node is running _npm start_ or _npm install_ more than once. If you are getting different errors when you install, it is because the installation process is still moving forward. Internal errors in a dependency can partially break an install. Try to avoid running as sudo, this is not usually required.\r\n\r\nEnsure that you have the correct software installed to begin, and that the directory in which you are running npm start contains the bob-angular seed files. Consult your console, and Google, to take care of any issues unique to your system.\r\n\r\n## Directory Layout\r\n\r\n```\r\n.bowerrc                               --> directs bower to load libs\r\n.gitignore                             --> the files that are excluded\r\napp/                                   --> application source files\r\n  assets/                              --> media, CSS JS, JSON assets\r\n    css, js, media\r\n  components/                          --> view or feature based components\r\n    footer, main, context, navigation  --> view components\r\n    youtube, leaflet, svg              --> feature (vendor) based components\r\n  shared/                              --> feature based shared services\r\n    three_module, country_module        \r\n  libs/                                --> repository for bower-created \r\n    3l, angular, bootstrap, three.js,      source files from 'npm start' or  \r\n    jquery, less, ui-router, others        'bower install' \r\n  app.js                               --> main application module\r\n  index.html                           --> the entrace point to the app.\r\nbower.json                             --> client-side libraries to install\r\nexports.index.js                       --> express server for testing\r\nGruntfile.js                           --> Creates the files that go in dist\r\nindex.js                               --> express server \r\nkarma.conf.js                          --> config file for Karma unit tests \r\npackage.json                           --> instruction files for npm \r\nProcfile                               --> runs _node index.js_ on heroku\r\ndist/                                  --> grunt-created after bower install\r\nnode_modules/                          --> created during install\r\ntests/                                 --> supporting files for tests \r\ntests/e2e-tests/                       --> end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAll of the unit and E2E tests were written using the [Jasmine][jasmine] framework.\r\n\r\n### Unit Tests\r\n\r\nThe [karma][karma] unit tests are set up in the components folders that they are associated with. Additional tests will be developed for services distinctly and throughout the app as opportunities are identified.\r\n\r\nSample file and location:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp/components/footer/footer.html\r\n                      footer.js\r\n                      footer_test.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the footer_test file contains the actual karma tests that are run.  To run the unit tests, enter the following into the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n### E2E Tests                      \r\n\r\nThe E2E tests require two terminal windows to be open: one with the local server, the other for [protractor][protractor]. This is facilitated by first starting the server by entering the following into the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\nThis window will launch an express server at localhost:3000. If this port is not available, you may need to edit exports.index.js. The console will give you a message to start the actual protractor in a new terminal window. From the same directory where you launched the server, bob-angular, enter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run protractor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results of the tests will be given in the second console window after running the script.\r\n\r\n### One Script for Unit and E2E Tests\r\n\r\nA streamlined testing mechanism is available through entering the following command at the root of the repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run fulltest\r\n```\r\nThis will run the unit tests first and then launch the server for protractor e2e testing in a second window. The e2e component requires you to open a new window while the server is running in the original window. From the same directory where you launched the server, bob-angular, enter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run protractor\r\n```\r\nSome other scripts you may find useful once it is installed are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode index.js            (for starting express server)\r\nnode exports.index.js    (express testing server, with instructions)\r\nnpm run launch-selenium  (for starting selenium server)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test section, like the other parts of this experiment, is incomplete. It will include device and server combinations as they are ready for publishing.\r\n\r\nThe application uses a postgres database with one table and four fields. There is an SQL file at the URL below that can be used to create a table on your system if you want to have the postgres component function. Within the application, default text JSON is available for those without the database.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/app/assets/media/countries.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nbob-angular is currently under constant development. As features are added and content explored, additional tests will be added to those currently included.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nFor more information on bob-angular please contact kevin@planetkevin.com\r\n\r\n[angular]: http://angularjs.org/\r\n[angularseed]:https://github.com/angular/angular-seed\r\n[three]: http://threejs.org/\r\n[express]: http://expressjs.com/\r\n[postgres]: http://www.postgresql.org/\r\n[git]: http://git-scm.com/\r\n[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/\r\n[bower]: http://bower.io\r\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/\r\n[node]: http://nodejs.org\r\n[less]: http://lesscss.org/\r\n[bootstrap]:http://getbootstrap.com/\r\n[jquery]: http://jquery.org/\r\n[leaflet]:http://leafletjs.com/\r\n[protractor]: https://github.com/angular/protractor\r\n[jasmine]: http://jasmine.github.io\r\n[karma]: http://karma-runner.github.io\r\n[bobangular]: http://bob-angular.herokuapp.com/\r\n[bobangularApp]:https://github.com/KevinEverywhere/bob-angular-app\r\n[bobangularWP]:https://bobangular.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
