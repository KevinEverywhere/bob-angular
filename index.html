<a id="version-000" class="anchor" href="#version-000" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>version 0.0.0</h3>

<p><em>This is in development and is not recommended to develop with as a base until version 0.0.1. You can still look under the hood to see how things work by following the installation process.</em></p>

<p>The sample application that is built from this code is viewable at 
<a href="http://bob-angular.herokuapp.com/">bob-angular</a>. The client-side
code can be seen at the <a href="https://github.com/KevinEverywhere/bob-angular-app">bob-angular-app</a>
repository.</p>

<p>This project is influenced by and borrows from <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed">angular-seed</a>. It uses <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a> to provide a means to map 2D Web content to 3D space. </p>

<p>The application is preconfigured to install the Angular framework, three.js, and required third-party frameworks. The seed app contains video, Leaflet map tiles, SVG and HTML content, built on top of bootstrap, JQuery, less and other familiar frameworks. It also includes unit and e2e tests. The application itself is built by grunt into the dist directory. It is built during the install process and can be seen at the bob-angular-app repository.</p>

<h3>
<a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. All other dependencies
are managed by node through package.json, and then bower through bower.json and grunt
through Gruntfile. You can get node and npm from <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="clone-bob-angular" class="anchor" href="#clone-bob-angular" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clone bob-angular</h3>

<p>In the terminal, in the directory where you want to install the app, git clone the 
bob-angular repository. Then, run <em>npm start</em> to install and launch the node 
web server; or <em>npm install</em> to merely install the application dependencies without
launching the web server. </p>

<p><em>Permission issues may occur if the directory permission and user permissions are different.</em></p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/KevinEverywhere/bob-angular.git
cd bob-angular
npm start 
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="install-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#install-dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install Dependencies</h3>

<p>There are server-side, application and testing dependencies loaded in  <code>npm</code>, 
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">node package manager</a>, and in the front-end development dependencies
through <code>bower</code>, a <a href="http://bower.io">client-side code package manager</a>.</p>

<p>The npm install and npm start scripts will install two new directories, 
and then populate them with imported code:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>node_modules</code> - contains the npm packages for the tools we need</li>
<li>
<code>app/libs</code> - contains the angular framework files</li>
</ul>

<p>*The <code>libs</code> folder is put into the app folder  through the <code>.bowerrc</code> file when 
'bower install' is run.</p>

<h3>
<a id="distribute-code" class="anchor" href="#distribute-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Distribute Code</h3>

<p>The next step is handled internally: through Gruntfile, grunt selects the 
necessary files from app/libs and creates a directory structure child to the 
dist directory. The application run from app and dist/app are the same in 
function, but dist/app files are less than a quarter the size.</p>

<h3>
<a id="run-the-application" class="anchor" href="#run-the-application" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Run the Application</h3>

<p>The application should be testable in localhost:3000 by running <em>npm start</em>. 
If that port is already being used, look at the console to see which port 
that the application found available.</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<p>The app should now be running at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> (or an alternative that was found to be available at runtime).</p>

<h4>
<a id="troubleshooting" class="anchor" href="#troubleshooting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Troubleshooting</h4>

<p><em>The most common errors with installation require nothing more than running the start or install commands two or more times.</em> </p>

<p>The most typical problems in <em>npm start</em> involve permission issues, availability of port, and software availability. The first thing I always try with node is running <em>npm start</em> or <em>npm install</em> more than once. If you are getting different errors when you install, it is because the installation process is still moving forward. Internal errors in a dependency can partially break an install. Try to avoid running as sudo, this is not usually required.</p>

<p>Ensure that you have the correct software installed to begin, and that the directory in which you are running npm start contains the bob-angular seed files. Consult your console, and Google, to take care of any issues unique to your system.</p>

<h2>
<a id="testing" class="anchor" href="#testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>

<h3>
<a id="unit-tests" class="anchor" href="#unit-tests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unit Tests</h3>

<p>The karma unit tests are set up in the components folders that they are associated with. Additional tests will be developed for services distinctly and throughout the app as opportunities are identified.</p>

<p>Sample file and location:</p>

<pre><code>app/components/footer/footer.html
                      footer.js
                      footer_test.js
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the footer_test file contains the actual karma tests that are run.  To run the unit tests, enter the following into the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>npm test
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="e2e-tests" class="anchor" href="#e2e-tests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>E2E Tests</h3>

<p>The E2E tests require two terminal windows to be open: one with the local server, the other for protractor. This is facilitated by first starting the server by entering the following into the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<p>This window will launch an express server at localhost:3000. If this port is not available, you may need to edit exports.index.js. The console will give you a message to start the actual protractor in a new terminal window. From the same directory where you launched the server, bob-angular, enter:</p>

<pre><code>npm run protractor
</code></pre>

<p>The results of the tests will be given in the second console window after running the script.</p>

<h3>
<a id="one-script-for-unit-and-e2e-tests" class="anchor" href="#one-script-for-unit-and-e2e-tests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>One Script for Unit and E2E Tests</h3>

<p>A streamlined testing mechanism is available through entering the following command at the root of the repository:</p>

<pre><code>npm run fulltest
</code></pre>

<p>This will run the unit tests first and then launch the server for protractor e2e testing in a second window. The e2e component requires you to open a new window while the server is running in the original window. From the same directory where you launched the server, bob-angular, enter:</p>

<pre><code>npm run protractor
</code></pre>

<p>Some other scripts you may find useful once it is installed are:</p>

<pre><code>node index.js            (for starting express server)
node exports.index.js    (express testing server, with instructions)
npm run launch-selenium  (for starting selenium server)

</code></pre>

<p>The test section, like the other parts of this experiment, is incomplete. It will include device and server combinations as they are ready for publishing.</p>

<p>bob-angular is currently under constant development. As features are added and content explored, additional tests will be added to those currently included.</p>
